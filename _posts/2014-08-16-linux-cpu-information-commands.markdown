Sometimes you need to know more about your CPU. Linux ofer at least two nice commands to do so.

## Command lscpu

- CPU architecture information
- less information but human readable

Type `lscpu`

![lscpu](/assets/icode/lscpu.png)

## /proc/cpuinfo

- more information

Type `cat /proc/cpuinfo`

Result looks like on the following image
