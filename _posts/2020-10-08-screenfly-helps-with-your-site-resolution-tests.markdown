Screenfly offers also other useful tools.

You can try custom resolution, refresh the resolution, rotate the screen or share the results with your friends.

Main benefit is that you do not need to use different harware to see how your web is looking like.
Just from one website you are able to see a lot of different resolution or try custom one.
